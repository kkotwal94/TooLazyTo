# TooLazyTo

#Summary 
This was a app our group at the udel hackathon attempted to do in October 2014. The outcome was pretty bad and we were trying to wrap our heads around a lot of things. Now its like July 2015 and I think I can finish it up. 

Original Project : https://github.com/keithyong/too-lazy

#ToDO:
Set up posts and comments, to routes by ID

Example : 
  app.get('/toolazy/:posts) {
      //Query by id here and grab post
      //render file here that displays post
      });

Create a upvote system for posts and comments
Create a commenting system, allow users to reply, have nested comments
Allow only @udel.edu users to join/signup
Use new release of Reactjs
Try to webpack this
Implement alloy editor for commenting rather than text area
