# TooLazyTo

#Summary 
This was a app our group at the udel hackathon attempted to do in October 2014. The outcome was pretty bad and we were trying to wrap our heads around a lot of things. Now its like July 2015 and I think I can finish it up. 

Original Project : https://github.com/keithyong/too-lazy

#ToDO:


* Alloyeditor needs to have better css positioning on modal, it renders on top of the UINode well, however it is all out of place. Located in ocean.css
* Allow users to upload images or icons for their profile pic
* At the end of project remember to use compiled versions of css, and webpack everything
* Incorporate alloy editor for each text area that is opened up, therefore having multiple alloyeditors
* Potential subreddits, I don't know doesn't seem worth it?
* Pagination for when too many entries(of posts) exist

#Updates:

* Added Comment tree collapse
* Fixed Date string to say 'time' ago
* Fixed plus minus icon
* Fixed crashing on replying to a comment deleted in the database, in other users unupdated view
* Added a 404 not found custom page
