# TooLazyTo

#Summary 
This was a app our group at the udel hackathon attempted to do in October 2014. The outcome was pretty bad and we were trying to wrap our heads around a lot of things. Now its like July 2015 and I think I can finish it up. 

Original Project : https://github.com/keithyong/too-lazy

#ToDO:
* Replace contains method, there has to be a more efficient way to removing objects from specific arrays in mongo, and not leaving it null
* Look into flux for a good upvote system. Right now database updates well, but in front end it interferes with other real-time functions like search. Need a better front end display of upvotes
* Alloyeditor needs to have better css positioning on modal, it renders on top of the UINode well, however it is all out of place. Located in ocean.css
* Allow users to upload images or icons for their profile pic
* At the end of project remember to use compiled versions of css, and webpack everything
* So much redundant code to look at and clean up(lookin at you react .jsx files)
* Create a good front end view of nested comments. Want it to look reddit style.
* Incorporate alloy editor for each text area that is opened up, therefore having multiple alloyeditors
* User profile view, loads up users posts and comments slow, or it doesnt at all sometimes, need consistent method
