# TooLazyTo

#Summary 
This was a app our group at the udel hackathon attempted to do in October 2014. The outcome was pretty bad and we were trying to wrap our heads around a lot of things. Now its like July 2015 and I think I can finish it up. 

Original Project : https://github.com/keithyong/too-lazy

#ToDO:


* Alloyeditor needs to have better css positioning on modal, it renders on top of the UINode well, however it is all out of place. Located in ocean.css
* Allow users to upload images or icons for their profile pic
* At the end of project remember to use compiled versions of css, and webpack everything
* Incorporate alloy editor for each text area that is opened up, therefore having multiple alloyeditors
* Add upvote system for comments as well, make the arrows change to green and red when hit, and store it in session
* Potential subreddits, I don't know doesn't seem worth it?
* Add in SCASS for some kind of object oriented css like structure (it extends css)
